#Alfa
This is my first ever fully functional react web app, thus "alfa". 
I will be following the instructions from the LinkedIn Learning tutorial "React.js: Building an Interface" by Ray Villalobos.
The design and features will be based on the tutorial but customized to create a slightly different end product.
I do not intent to claim complete ownership, this is just a personal learning exercise.
